I have decided to try to log my activity on the CodeWars website.

For each of the languages I solve katas in, I will have a dedicated directory.

Kata files will have a commented sectioni at the head that describes the problem
solution requirements.

Below the solution requirements, and still in the comment head, will be the link to
the actual kata page, so you can try it yourself.

Following the head section will be the actual solution that I cam  up with.

A footer comment line will denote the end of the solution, and may or may not contain
any text lines that I added for local testing.

If you wish to 'cheat' by using my solution rather than learning from it, you can copy
and paste everything between the upper comment header, and the footer comment.

Have fun.
